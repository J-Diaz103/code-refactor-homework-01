1. The first issue found was at the header of the page. when the href did not move to the viewport to the correct possition.
    to fix the issue I added an id to the corresponding div atribute.

2. I changed the title to the name on the web page so the search engine can recognize it when  it is searched for

3. use the header tag to indicate that it is not just another div tag. for organizational puposes.

4a 4b. I changed this div tags to section tags to make it reader friendly and break away from clumpping a ton of div tags 
        together.

5 a-f. For this I just added the alt names to make sure that if the image doesn't load whoever was tried to see it they would be 
        able to get an idea of what should be there.
